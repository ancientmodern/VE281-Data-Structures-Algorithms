# VE281 - Data Structures and Algorithms (Fall 2020)
Welcome to the repo for Fall 2020 VE 281 - Data Structures and Algorithms.

**For academic integrity, we advise you to thoroughly review the JI Honor Code available [here](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/academics/academic-integrity/honor-code/).**

Inside you'll find the source code for all Projects completed during the term. **Remember to respect academic integrity!!!**

## CHANGELOG
- [x] 11/01/2020 Finish P1.
- [x] 11/03/2020 Finish P2.
- [x] 11/25/2020 Finish P3.
- [x] 12/12/2020 Finish P4.
- [x] 12/17/2020 Survive!
- [x] Finally got A+, thanks Prof. Xin!

## Note
**P3 has some bugs in the function `operator=`, which would unexpectedly cost a lot of memory. Remember to check the self-assignment first and destory the original instance. I'm too naive at that time...**
